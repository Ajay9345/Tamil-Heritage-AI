📜 Project Motivation

Tamil history and literature are rich but often scattered across academic websites, inscriptions, and literary sources. Accessing this knowledge usually requires:

Prior historical background

Manual searching across multiple sources

Reading complex academic explanations

Tamil Heritage AI solves this by:

Collecting authentic Tamil heritage content

Structuring it into a searchable knowledge base

Providing an interactive chatbot for easy exploration

📚 Data Source

The primary data for this project is collected from:

Tamil Virtual Academy (tamilvu.org)
→ Tamil Language & Literature sections

The dataset includes content related to Tamil scripts, Sangam literature, poets, inscriptions, dynasties, and cultural themes.
