Other names given to the Sangam Tamil script:

These scripts are variously called Tamil, Tamil Brahmi, and Palan Tamil. The reason for this is as follows: Although the North Indian Brahmi scripts and the scripts used in Sangam Tamil Nadu are similar in shape, there are many differences. “Tamil” does not have class letters. There are no compound letters and sibilants. Similarly, the ಴, ಳ, ರ, ನ forms in the Tamil script are not in North Indian Brahmi. While the Brahmi scripts found in other parts of India are in the Prakrit language (for teaching Buddhism), only the Tamil language is used in Tamil Nadu. Therefore, in order to distinguish the Brahmi scripts found in Tamil Nadu from the North Indian Brahmi, they are called Tamil Brahmi or Tamil. We can call these the Sangam Tamil scripts. Those scripts are shown here.

Reason for the name:

The Brahmi inscriptions found throughout India mostly contain Prakrit language. But the inscriptions found in Tamil Nadu contain only Tamil language. Some Prakrit script forms (ச, த4) and a few Prakrit words (த4 மமம் ஸாலகன்) are very rare. Therefore, despite the similarity in writing, the name given to the ancient Tamil script found in the Sangam period due to language and some special features to distinguish it from the current Tamil script and the Asoka Brahmi script is “தமிழ்” or “தமிழ் பரமி”. The Brahmi script found in Tamil Nadu was named “தமிழ் பரமி” by Airavatham Mahadeva. Similarly, the name “தமிழ் பரமி” was given by Nagasamy. This is referred to as “Ancient Tamil Scripts” by Natasa Kasinathan and S.Irasavel.

There is a theory that Rishabhadeva (the first Tirthankara) of Jainism had two daughters, one of whom was named “Sundari” and the other daughter was named “Brahmi”, with Sundari representing language and Brahmi representing writing. Ganesha also says that this theory is explained in Bhagavatam 5.
