## Section 2: Script Origins and Naming

### Etymology of "Brahmi"
**Named by**: French scholar Terrian de Lacoffery (1886)
**Basis**: Buddhist and Jain religious literature
**Alternative Names**: Lath/Lat, Ashoka Brahmi, Maurya Brahmi, Indian Pali, Dhammalibi

### Jain Theory of Script Origin
According to Jain tradition, Rishabhadeva (first Tirthankara) had two daughters:
- **Sundari**: Represented language
- **Brahmi**: Represented writing
Source: Referenced in Bhagavatam 5

### "Tamil" as Script Name
**Jain Text Evidence**: Samavayanga Suddha and Pannavana Suddha mention "Tamil" as a script
**Buddhist Text**: Lalitavisthara lists 64 scripts including "Tamil"
**Dating**: Jain text from 1st century BCE is oldest reference
**Pronunciation Note**: Northern speakers pronounced Tamil as "Thamizhi" due to difficulty with "ழ" sound

### Regional Variations
**Dravidian**: Later name (5th-6th century CE) for Telugu, Kannada, Grantham scripts
**South Brahmi**: Brahmi in Deccan region post-Ashoka (excludes Tamil Nadu and Pattiporulu)
**Nomenclature Authority**: Airavatham Mahadevan for regional classifications

---

## Section 3: Origin Theories of Sangam Tamil Scripts

### Mahadevan's Theory
**Origin**: North Indian Ashoka Brahmi
**Transmission**: Through Jainism and Buddhism influence
**Chronology**: Upper period dated to 2nd century BCE
**Acceptance**: Time calculation mostly accepted by scholars with scientific approach

### Alternative Indigenous Theory
**Proponents**: I. Nagasamy, Natana Kasinathan, K.V. Ramesh, M.D. Sampath, K. Rajan, S. Irasavelu
**Claim**: Ancient Tamil script predates Ashoka Brahmi
**Evidence Base**: Inscription study, writing style, socio-cultural environment

### K.V. Ramesh's Position
- Brahmi scripts across India in rudimentary state
- Regional linguists adapted scripts to local languages
- Tamil Brahmi cave inscriptions date to 4th century BC
- Maurya period population was literate

### K. Rajan's Archaeological Evidence
**Basis**: Soil research and archaeological findings
**Conclusion**: Tamil Brahmi predates Ashoka period
**Supporting Evidence**: Pottery from Azhakan Kulam excavations showing public literacy before 400 BC

### S. Irasavelu's Foreign Reference Analysis
**Sources**: Megasthenes, Strabo, Arrian accounts
**Claim**: Indians during Ashoka period were illiterate according to foreigners
**Evidence**: Ashoka Brahmi inscriptions show regular, complete structure
**Conclusion**: Writing existed in India before Ashoka; Tamil Nadu public literate by 400 BC

---

## Section 4: Script Evolution and Development

### Indus Valley Connection
**Modern Consensus**: Indus Valley Civilization was Dravidian
**Script Nature**: Partly pictographic, partly phonetic
**Brahmi Origin Theories**:
1. Cunningham: Evolved from Indus Valley script
2. Counter-argument: Voweled consonant Brahmi couldn't derive from Indus pictographic
3. North Semitic (Arabic) theory: Originated around 700 BCE

### Eran Kasal Evidence
**Writing Direction**: Initially right-to-left, then left-to-right
**Text**: "Dhambalasa"
**Significance**: Oldest known Brahmi script

### Tamil Script Adaptation
- Created when Brahmi appeared
- Tamil experts adopted Arabic script ideas
- Modified for Tamil sounds: ழ, ள, ர, ன
- All Tamil Nadu inscriptions: left-to-right direction
- Pre-3rd century BC dating (K. Rajan)

### Letter Type Classification
**Vowel to Consonant System**: Tolkappiyam references show Tamil alphabets combine consonants with vowels
**Classification**: Voweled consonant system (not pure alphabetic)

---

## Section 5: Language Research and Findings

### Early Scholarly Debates
**Initial Theory**: Venkaiah and Krishnasastri believed inscriptions were Prakrit
**Correction**: K.V. Subramania Iyer established Tamil language basis
**Confirmation**: Airavatham Mahadevan's comprehensive research

### Linguistic Analysis
**Tamil Purity**: All Tamil Brahmi inscriptions in Tamil Nadu are Tamil language
**Prakrit Influence**: 25% contain Prakrit words
**Prakrit Source**: Related to North Indian Prakrit (not East Indian as in Ashoka)
**Jain Connection**: Mahadevan notes Jain orientation influenced language choice

**Region**: Tamil Nadu

### Etymology
**Name Meaning**: "Vatthi" = circular shape

### Origin Theories
**D.A. Gopinath Rao**: First suggested origin from Tamil-Brahmi
**Opposition (Due to Lack of Evidence)**:
- Hariprasad Shastri: From Kharoshti
- Bueller: Variant of Tamil-Brahmi for merchants only
- Barnal: From Phoenician script

**Modern Confirmation**: Evidence from Arachalur, Phulangurichi, Indalur, Arasalapuram, Perumukkal, Amman Koilpatti clearly shows development from Tamil script

**Regional Pattern**: Most early circular inscriptions in northern Tamil Nadu

### Usage Patterns

**Thondai Mandalam**: Large numbers on Nadukals (memorial stones for fallen soldiers)
**Pallava Period**: Common official script
**Pandya Kingdom**: Official script evidenced by 7th century CE Velvikudi copper plates
**Geographic Spread**: Throughout Tamil Nadu by 4th-5th century CE (pottery evidence from Poluvampatti, Andipatti excavations)

### Obsolescence

## Section 13: Tamil Alphabet Development

### Emergence
**Period**: From 6th century CE
**Parallel Development**: Tamil and Vattezhuthu scripts coexisted
**Mixed Usage**: Sometimes found together in same inscription

### First Clear Form
**Pallava King**: Simhavarman's Pallan temple inscription
**Dating Issue**: Actually 8th century CE (later than initially thought)

**Vallam Inscription** (Mahendravarman): Entirely Tamil
**Thirukkazhukundra Inscription** (Narasimhavarman I): Mixed with circular script
**Later Copper Plates**: Grantham and Tamil
**Temple Inscriptions**: Tamil, Grantham, Nagaram scripts
**Nadukals**: Circular script

**Earliest Tamil Nadukal**: Melsanarakuppam inscription (743 CE) - Nandivarman II

---

## Section 14: Writing System Origins

### Foreword on Writing
**Definition**: Writing is form of speech
**Ancient Evidence**: Nadukal (stone carving) custom in Tamil literature

### Nadukal Tradition
**Purpose**: Honor warriors who fought without fear
**Content**: Name and glory written on stone
**Literary Reference**: Akananuru 67 - "Maravar Peerum Peedum Chere Peeli Suttiya Pirangunilai Nadukal"
**Tolkappiyam Reference**: "Katkshi, Kalkol, Neerpadai, Nadukal, Perumpadai Vazhatthal"

### Writing Development
**Origin**: Gradual development from stone inscriptions
**Methods**: Written by hand, chanted by mouth
**Types**: Cursive and syllabic

### Palaeography Study
**Definition**: Study of ancient writing based on paintings as foundation

### Three Types of Writing

#### 1. Pictography (Painted Writing)
**Origin**: Ancient hunters' communication tricks evolved into paintings
**Examples**: Cave paintings in France and Spain (still existing)
**Development**: Collections of sentences → small paintings → symbols for each word
**Tamil Example**: Temple cow donation - cow head painting with dots indicating number
**Modern Examples**: Chinese and Japanese (one shape per word system still exists)

#### 2. Ideography (Cursive Writing)
**Evolution**: Developed from pictorial writings
**Distinction**: Sun picture as "sun" = pictorial; sun representing "daytime" or "heat" = cursive

#### 3. Phonography
**Revolutionary Change**: Picture symbol became symbol for first sound of word
**Example**: Greek "alpha" (bull) - bull's head picture became "a" sound symbol

### Character Type Classifications

#### Alphabets
**Method**: Dividing vowels and consonants
**Example**: Tamil "க" divided as "ka" in English (consonant + vowel separate)

#### Vowel Consonants (Uyir Mee Vaga)
**Method**: Not dividing, writing as single form
**Example**: Tamil "க" written without division
**Tamil Language**: Uses vowel consonant type

### Vowel Type Evolution
**First Appearance**: When phonetic evolved from pictographic
**Problem**: Letters multiplied innumerably; very difficult to remember

### Alphabetic Category
**Invention**: North Semitic peoples (Syria and Palestine)
**Date**: Around 1500 BC
**Tamil Script**: Classified as "Uyir Mee Vaga" (vowel consonant) type
